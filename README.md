        ## WEEKLY- CHALLENGE : REFACTORING ##

This weekly challenge is based on Refactoring. In this challenge, we had to make sure everything was working correctly (links, images, etc.) as well as clean up the code making it easier to read.
 I'll be telling you about the few things I changed to achieve this task: 
1.First, I noticed in the CSS file, alot of the code was redundant. So, I simply combned them without changing the functionality and appearance of the site. 
2. Secondly, I went and added the "alt" attribute to all the pictures, since there were none. 3. 
Third, I gave the articles the same class, so it would be less code in the CSS file and less redundant. 
4. I condensed the footer, and made the code for the footer more simple.
